animation
animation: AnimationAsset
Points to the animation asset to be played by the Animation Player.

begin
begin: number
Returns begin time of clip.

blendMode
blendMode: AnimationLayerBlendMode
The blend mode for this particular clip.

disabled
disabled: boolean
Whether the animation clip is disabled.

Readonly
duration
duration: number
Returns the duration of the clip which is calculated based on the begin and end times.

end
end: number
Returns end time of clip.

Readonly
name
name: string
Name of the clip.

playbackMode
playbackMode: PlaybackMode
Choose whether to play animation clip once, loop the clip, or ping pong it.

playbackSpeed
playbackSpeed: number
Scalar value to represent playback speed percentage. 1.0 is 100% playback speed.

reversed
reversed: boolean
Specifies if the clip should be played reversed.

scaleMode
scaleMode: AnimationLayerScaleMode
How scale is accumulated. Usually does not need to be changed after import.

weight
weight: number
Strength of animation clip contribution. Lies between [0.0, 1.0] inclusive. For default blending a 1.0 weight indicates this clip will override all earlier clips, a less than 1.0 weight indicates it will blend onto the calculated pose using a weighted average.

clone
clone(clipName): AnimationClip
Clones the existing clip with a new name.

Parameters

clipName: string
Returns AnimationClip

getTypeName
getTypeName(): string
Returns the name of this object's type.

Returns string

Inherited from ScriptObject.getTypeName

isOfType
isOfType(type): boolean
Returns true if the object matches or derives from the passed in type.

Parameters

type: string
Returns boolean

Inherited from ScriptObject.isOfType

isSame
isSame(other): boolean
Returns true if this object is the same as other. Useful for checking if two references point to the same thing.

Parameters

other: ScriptObject
Returns boolean

Inherited from ScriptObject.isSame
